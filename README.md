## Configuration

Before running the app, you must complete these setup steps:

### 1. Select Development Team
In Xcode, select your app target and go to **Signing & Capabilities**. Choose your **Development Team** from the dropdown to enable code signing.

### 2. Add Your API Key
In order to unlock the SDK, you will need to provide your API key. You can create one at [https://app.argmaxinc.com](https://app.argmaxinc.com).

In `DefaultEnvInitializer.swift`, update the following code with your credentials:

```swift
public class DefaultEnvInitializer: PlaygroundEnvInitializer {

    public func createAPIKeyProvider() -> APIKeyProvider {
        return PlainTextAPIKeyProvider(
            apiKey: "", // TODO: Add your Argmax SDK API key
        )
    }
}
```

> **Do not commit your API key.**.
